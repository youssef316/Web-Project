DOHA, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Egyptian giants Zamalek won the African Super Cup 
by beating Esperance of Tunisia 3-1 
on Friday to lift the trophy for the fourth time.
Achraf Bencharki scored twice for Zamalek, who had taken a early lead through Youssef Obama.

Esperance, who won last season’s African Champions League, equalised with Abdelraouf Benguit's penalty before Bencharki struck for the 2018-19 African Confederation Cup winners. </p>
